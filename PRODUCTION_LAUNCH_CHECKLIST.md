# 🚀 Production Launch Checklist

## Critical: No Demo Data Approach

**Why Demo Data is Wrong for Production:**
- Creates false expectations
- Masks real issues
- Wastes development time
- Confuses users
- Not scalable

**Production Approach:**
- Real market data feeds
- Real user registration
- Real order placement
- Real balance management
