# Architecture

## System Overview

Feathered Finance Launch is a modern web application built with React, TypeScript, and Supabase. The application follows a component-based architecture with a focus on maintainability, scalability, and performance.

## Technology Stack

### Frontend
- React 18.3.1
- TypeScript 5.5.3
- Vite 5.4.1
- TailwindCSS 3.4.11
- Radix UI + Shadcn
- React Query
- React Router 6.26.2

### Backend
- Supabase
- PostgreSQL
- Edge Functions

### Development Tools
- ESLint
- TypeScript
- Husky
- Vite

## Architecture Patterns

### Component Architecture
- Atomic Design principles
- Reusable UI components
- Custom hooks for business logic
- Context for global state

### State Management
- React Query for server state
- Context API for global UI state
- Local state for component-specific data

### Data Flow
1. User interactions trigger component events
2. Events are handled by custom hooks
3. Hooks interact with API services
4. API services communicate with Supabase
5. Data flows back through the same path

## Security Architecture
